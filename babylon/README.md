# VRSpace: Multiuser Virtual Reality Engine

Client library for the VRSpace.org server.

Basic classes (client/vrspace.js) contain websocket client and data types with no external dependencies.
Generated OpenApi classes require superagent that is included in the distribution.

Everything else depends on on these, and on babylon.js.
